JSONsimple should work with the project out of the box. If not, follow these steps:
1. Download the latest JSONsimple JAR file from https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/downloads
2. Add the JAR file to the build path for the project (right click project > build path > configure build path > libraries > add external JAR file > then add the JSONsimple JAR file you downloaded)
